# INTRODUCTION
                The demography of the world population shows a trend that the elderly population world wide is increasing rapidly as a result of the increase of the average live expectancy of people .Home automation is one of the major growing industries that can change the way people live. Some of these home automation systems target those seeking luxury and sophisticated home automation platforms; others target those with special needs like the elderly and the disabled. The aim of the reported Wireless Home Automation System (WHAS) is to provide those with special needs with a system that can respond to voice commands and control the on/off status of electrical devices, such as lamps, fans, television etc, in the home. The system should be reasonably cheap, easy to configure, and easy to run. There have been several commercial and research projects on smart homes and voice recognition systems .In our project ,the system has been designed to assist and provide the support to elderly and disabled people at home. The voice input has been captured by the android and will be sent to the Ardiuno Uno. The home automation through this system requires holding and interacting with a large panel which constraints the physical movements of the user. In our project we concludes by looking at the future research and development work required to make the system more versatile
# MERITS:
               *Ease of access and low cost and power consumption.
               *Helps old age people to control the remote devices. 
               *Can be implemented at any device and automated.
               *Can reduce human effort. 
               *Error probability reduced and Simple Interface.
               *Eliminates the use of PC for automation. 
               *Smarter processing and services Alert system is quick in case of an emergency.
# DEMERITS:
               *High dependency on sensor devices which makes the system vulnerable if sensor fails. 
               *Replacing human is dangerous. 
               *Vulnerable to attacks.
               *Security Concerns.
               *May take time and learning.
               *Most of the time range is restricted.

# Conclusion:
                A home automation system based on voice recognition was built and implemented. The system is targetted at elderly and disabled people. The prototype developed 
can control electrical devices in a home or office. The system implements Automatic Speech Recognition engines through Microsoft speech APIs. The system implements the wireless network using ZigBee RF modules for their efficiency and low power consumption. Multimedia streaming through the network was implemented with the help of the Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) compression algorithms that allows to compress the speech data to half of its original data size. The preliminary test results are promising.
