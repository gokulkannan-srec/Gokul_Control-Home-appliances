            A Test Plan refers to a detailed document that catalogs the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimations, deadlines, and the resources required for completing that particular project. Think of it as a blueprint for running the tests needed to ensure the software is working properly â€“ controlled by test managers.

            A well-crafted test plan is a dynamic document that changes according to progressions in the project and stays current at all times. It is the point of reference, based on which testing activities are executed and coordinated among a QA team.

            The test plan is also shared with Business Analysts, Project Managers, Dev teams, and anyone else associated with the project, This mainly offers transparency into QA activities so that all stakeholders know how the software will be tested.

            The plan is built by QA managers or leads based on input from QA (and sometimes, non-QA) team members. Creating it should not take more than 1/3rd of the time allocated for the entire project.
